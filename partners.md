            You don't need to attend every one of our events but successful projects do require consistency. Some of our members may be interested in helping you lead the project in which case they show up to events and work on the project while coordinating with you so that you can attend less frequently.
    </p>
    <p>
            Some projects also organize additional working sessions independent of Civic Tech DC events to make even faster and more focused progress.
