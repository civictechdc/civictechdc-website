    <h4 class="usa-process-list__heading">Get in touch</h4>
    <p>
            We're always looking for new and impactful projects where we can use skills to help our community. You can get in touch by emailing us at <a href="mailto:hello@civictechdc.org" target="_blank">hello@civictechdc.org</a> to see if your project is a good fit with Civic Tech DC. This may be some email back-and-forth, a virtual chat, or meeting in person to hear more about the problem you're facing.
    </p>

  <li class="usa-process-list__item">
    <h4 class="usa-process-list__heading">Develop a project plan and milestones</h4>
    <p>
            If your project sounds like a good fit we'll work with you to develop a loose project plan with achievable milestones. This will include a description of the problem you're solving, the technology or skills that you need to help solve it, and concrete steps that will build towards the solution.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="usa-process-list__item">
    <h4 class="usa-process-list__heading">Attend an event and pitch your project to see who wants to help build it</h4>
    <p>
            Attend one of our events where you can pitch your project to our members and start working on it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li class="usa-process-list__item">
    <h4 class="usa-process-list__heading">Continue attending events periodically to keep the work moving and on-track</h4>
    <p>
            You don't need to attend every one of our events but successful projects do require consistency. Some of our members may be interested in helping you lead the project in which case they show up to events and work on the project while coordinating with you so that you can attend less frequently.
    </p>
    <p>
            Some projects also organize additional working sessions independent of Civic Tech DC events to make even faster and more focused progress.
