# Civic Tech DC Website

Welcome! This is the repository for the website for Civic Tech DC. It is a static site built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It is mostly Markdown/Liquid, HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

## Getting Started

### Local Development

1. First, make sure that you have <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git</a> on your computer. Create your own <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects">fork</a> of the repository, then clone it to your computer:

`git clone git@github.com:[YOUR GITHUB NAME]/codefordc-website`

2. Now, install the correct version of Ruby.

We use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) and its [ruby plugin](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby) to configure Ruby for this project. You can see which version of Ruby we're using in the [.tool-versions](.tool-versions) file.

First, if you're on Ubuntu, you may need to install some dependencies. If the `install` step doesn't work, try one or both of these commands:

```
sudo apt install libyaml-dev
sudo apt install libffi-dev
```

To install the Ruby plugin, run the following commands inside the project's directory:

```
asdf plugin add ruby https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-ruby.git
asdf install
```

3. Install dependencies.

`bundle install`
`npm install`

4. Run a local version of the website.

This command will run `gulp` as a background process and then jekyll as a foreground process.

`npm run serve`

5. Open a web browser page at `localhost:4000`
