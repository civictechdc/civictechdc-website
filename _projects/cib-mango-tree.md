    <h2 class="font-sans-lg">🏠 Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>CIB Mango Tree supports researchers in detecting and responding to coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) online - one of the most subtle yet damaging threats to democratic discourse. Inspired by Taiwan’s civic tech spirit, this open-source project equips non-technical watchdogs with tools to analyze social media activity and uncover manipulation. By identifying low-hanging fruit like repeated phrases or synchronized posting times, CIB Mango Tree lowers the barrier to entry for <strong>civic engagement in digital spaces.</strong> In an age where disinformation silences genuine voices, we are working to create a more truthful internet.</p>

    <p>
    CIB Mango Tree democratizes access to powerful social media analysis tools and helps communities respond to online manipulation. Our prototype has been used to <strong>flag suspicious online activity during key moments like elections</strong>. Beyond the tools, we’ve built a community of volunteers and collaborators who are passionate about protecting open discourse, both in Washington, DC and globally.

    <p>CIB Mango Tree began with a simple idea rooted in admiration for Taiwan’s civic tech movement. Sparked in Washington, DC in August 2024, our project grew out of conversations among volunteers determined to build tools that help communities protect online discourse.</p>
