    <h2 class="font-sans-lg">🏠 Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Nearly 5,000 cyclists were involved in crashes in DC between 2013 and 2022, yet there is no easy way for riders to know which streets are safest before they ride. Cyclists often rely on instinct, word of mouth, or trial and error to find comfortable routes.  
    </p>

    <p>We are bridging this gap with a tool that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Visualizes street by street safety scores on an interactive color coded map</li>
      <li>Shows crash data, infrastructure quality, and traffic stress for each segment</li>
      <li>Identifies high impact opportunities for infrastructure improvements</li>
      <li>Supports Vision Zero DC’s goal of eliminating traffic deaths</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="font-sans-lg">📖 Our Story</h2>
    <p class="margin-bottom-2">
      RideScore DC was born from a simple question: "Why isn't there a safety rating for bike routes like there is for restaurants?" After discovering that DC has rich open data on crashes, bike lanes, and street characteristics — but no integrated safety scoring system — we decided to build one.
      <br><br>
      Inspired by proven methodologies like <a href="https://bna.peopleforbikes.org/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PeopleForBikes' Bicycle Network Analysis</a> and the Level of Traffic Stress framework, we're combining DC's excellent open data with modern data science to create actionable safety insights. Our goal is to leverage the same principles that helped cities like Minneapolis and Brooklyn dramatically improve their cycling networks.
