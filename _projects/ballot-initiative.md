    <em>We're building VoteCatcher - open source campaign infrastructure that puts powerful organizing tools in the hands of grassroots campaigns. Think processes, not apps.</em>

    <h2 class="font-sans-lg">üó≥Ô∏è Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Running a grassroots campaign is hard. Organizers are often stuck with tedious, manual processes or expensive, proprietary software that doesn't fit their needs. This creates a high barrier to entry, making it difficult for community-led efforts to get off the ground. <strong>We believe technology should make democratic participation easier, not harder.</strong></p>

    <h2 class="font-sans-lg">üõ†Ô∏è Our Approach: Processes, Not Just Tools</h2>
    <p>
    Instead of building standalone apps, we build and document open source <strong>processes</strong>. Our first project uses multimodal LLMs to achieve high-accuracy signature triaging, and we've already integrated it with the DC voter file for real-time validation.
    <br/><br/>
    Right now, we're focused on building out the full document processing and triaging workflow in Python. The goal is a reusable playbook that other campaigns can adapt for their own needs.

    <h2 class="font-sans-lg">üöÄ The Big Picture</h2>
    <p>Signature validation is just the beginning. The systems we're creating‚Äîfor voter file integration, data validation, and workflow automation‚Äîare the building blocks for a full suite of open source campaign infrastructure. Our vision is to support candidate campaigns, issue advocacy, and other community organizing efforts, letting them focus on what matters: talking to people.</p>

    <h2 class="font-sans-lg">üìñ Our Story</h2>
    <p>VoteCatcher grew out of conversations with organizers who were spending more time on data entry and money on expensive software than running their campaign. We're a group of volunteers who believe that good campaign technology should be a public resource, accessible to everyone‚Äînot just well-funded efforts with dedicated tech teams.</p>
