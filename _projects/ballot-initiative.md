Our goal is to create a way to automate the name and address validation process for ballot initiative petitions. 

When people are trying to get new initiatives on the ballot they need to collect thousands of signatures, names, and addresses from voters in their district and then check these signatures manually against voter registration records. Weâ€™re trying to automate the checking process.
