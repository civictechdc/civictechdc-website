# Help Build a Regional Resource for Home Electrification

The Electrify DC Contractor List project is an open-source initiative we're building in collaboration with [Electrify DC](https://electrifydc.org) to support the transition to cleaner, more efficient homes across the DMV region. By creating a high-visibility, searchable list of vetted contractors, we're empowering homeowners to find trusted professionals for their efficiency and electrification projects.

## Why this matters

Residential buildings account for about 75% of DC's total final emissions, with residential buildings making up a third of that. Electrifying our homes is a critical step in reducing these emissions, but many residents struggle to find qualified contractors who understand modern, sustainable technologies. Our goal is to bridge that gap.

By joining this project, you'll contribute to a tool that:

- Connects homeowners with qualified and trusted contractors.
- Provides digestible, localized information on rebates, incentives, and electrification.
- Supports the regional workforce by unlocked IRA funding and highlighting in-demand training and credentialing opportunities.

## Our tech stack

We're building this project with a modern, developer-friendly stack:

- Remix for a fast and dynamic full-stack web framework.
- React for a component-based frontend.
- TypeScript for safer, more predictable code.
- Tailwind CSS for clean, efficient styling.
- SQLite as a database and Prisma for the ORM.

## Who we're looking for

This project is a big liftâ€”and we need passionate volunteers with a variety of skills to make it happen! In particular, we're looking for:

ðŸŒŸ Project Management

Help us coordinate volunteers, keep us on track, and manage our roadmap. You'll be essential to guiding the project from idea to reality.

ðŸŽ¨ UX Design

We're seeking a designer to ensure our site is welcoming, intuitive, and accessible. Wireframes, user flows, and thoughtful design are critical to helping homeowners and contractors alike find what they need.

ðŸ›  Developers

Whether you're experienced with our tech stack or eager to learn, we welcome contributors who can help us build out the frontend, backend, and data integrations.

Join us at an upcoming project night or reach out in our Slack channel to get started!
