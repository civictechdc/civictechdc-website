  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Founded in 2012, Civic Tech DC is a non-partisan, non-political group of
    volunteer civic hackers working together to solve local issues in the
    Washington, DC area and helping people engage with the city. We host
    twice-monthly hacknights and other events to gather, discuss, and get stuff
    done.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're looking to bring people with all different skill sets together to
    maximize our potential. Civic hackers aren't just developers — they're
    journalists, lawyers, designers, and interested citizens in general. The
    more community participation, the better.
  </p>
