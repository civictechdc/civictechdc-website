          Founded in 2012, Civic Tech DC is a non-partisan, non-political group
          of volunteer civic hackers working together to solve local issues in
          the Washington, DC area and helping people engage with the city. We
          host twice-monthly hacknights and other events to gather, discuss, and
          get stuff done.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're looking to bring people with all different skill sets together
          to maximize our potential. Civic hackers aren't just developers —
          they're journalists, lawyers, designers, and interested citizens in
          general. The more community participation, the better.
