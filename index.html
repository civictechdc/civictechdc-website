    <!--
    Meetup event cards are rendered and then modified by the assets/js/meetup.js script.
    meetup.js makes a request to meetup.com to retrieve details about the next two events.
      * If there are no upcoming events scheduled then no changes are made.
      * If there is one upcoming event then the "next event" details are added.
      * If there are two upcoming events then the "next event" and "future event" details are added
        and the future event card is unhidden.

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Founded in 2012, Civic Tech DC is a non-partisan, non-political group of
    volunteer civic hackers working together to solve local issues in the
    Washington, DC area and helping people engage with the city. We host
    twice-monthly hacknights and other events to gather, discuss, and get stuff
    done.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're looking to bring people with all different skill sets together to
    maximize our potential. Civic hackers aren't just developers — they're
    journalists, lawyers, designers, and interested citizens in general. The
    more community participation, the better.
  </p>
