            <h3>üìç Venue Confirmed</h3>
            <p>
                We're excited to announce that we've secured the downstairs space at Taoti Creative for July 26. Taoti has been a longtime supporter of the civic tech community here in DC, and we're grateful to have them as both venue host and sponsor. Their commitment to using creative and technical expertise for social good aligns perfectly with our mission.

            <h3>üåü HackDC2025 Part 2: Fall 2025</h3>
            <p>
                The response to this hackathon has been incredible. We've heard from nonprofits, policy experts, and technologists who all see the same thing we do: this problem space is huge, urgent, and worth investing in.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we've explored the data and talked with partners, it's become clear that one event won't be enough. There's too much opportunity here to rush it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're still moving forward with the July 26 event. This first hackathon will focus on foundational data engineering work and analysis,anchored by a problem statement from CMS.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're also planning a follow-up event in Fall 2025. That extra runway will help us bring in more nonprofit collaborators, secure additional funding, and build on what we learn in July.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>This is shaping up to be an exciting problem space. Hope to see you on July 26th!</strong>

                A hackathon is a collaborative, time-limited event where participants come together to build innovative solutions‚Äîoften using technology‚Äîto address a specific challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                This hackathon brings together subject matter experts from government, nonprofits, and academia with experienced data engineers and data scientists to improve public access and understanding of stakeholder comments informing the federal rulemaking process.
            </p>
            <p>
                We seek individuals skilled in handling large datasets or proficient in data science and analysis, as well as those knowledgeable about the federal rulemaking process. Technical participants will build reusable tools, while policy experts will guide problem definition and ensure solutions meet real-world needs.

            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6;">
                By building open-source tools, we'll make it easier for citizens, researchers, agencies, and advocates to understand how public input shapes the rules that govern our lives.

            <p>
                For the past 50 years, when the federal government has proposed a rule through <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">Regulations.gov</a>, it has solicited public comment from stakeholders as part of the rulemaking process. Depending on the scope of the rule, the government may receive thousands of comments from individuals, advocates, and corporate interests. Agencies are required to meaningfully consider and respond to these comments before finalizing the rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, while the data is technically public, it's not practically usable. Comments are often locked away in PDFs, messy spreadsheets, and other formats that are difficult for data scientists and engineers to work with at scale. This creates a major barrier not just to public transparency, but to effective, data-driven policy analysis.

                To bridge this gap, Professor Ben Coleman and his students at Moravian University have developed a robust open-source data pipeline. Powered by donated API keys, their tool continuously downloads and publishes public comments across all federal agencies to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ypmw3cvvwhv3y"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">S3 bucket on AWS through its Open Data Platform</a>, making comments easily accessible to the public for exploration and analysis. The dataset includes over 2.3 TB of data (640 GB of text) and is updated every 4 hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this hackathon, we'll tackle real challenges in this data including multi-format inputs (JSON, PDFs, images, spreadsheets), low-quality OCR conversions, and complex metadata structures. The tools we build will be designed to work with any regulatory data‚Äîpast, present, or future‚Äîcreating lasting infrastructure for civic engagement. Professor Coleman will kick off the event with a comprehensive data tour, and we'll provide starter kits to help teams quickly begin building impactful solutions.

                <p style="font-weight: 500; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What makes a good problem statement?</p>
                <p>We're looking for real challenges you face when working with regulatory data. Think about:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;
                           margin-left: 2rem;
                           text-align: left;
                           line-height: 1.8">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">What questions about public comments frequently come up?</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">What insights would transform how your organization operates?</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">What data analysis would help you better serve your constituents?</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                    For example, a strong problem statement might focus on a specific challenge, such as:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;
                           margin-left: 2rem;
                           text-align: left;
                           line-height: 1.8">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">
                        <strong>Categorizing Commenters:</strong> How can we reliably identify and categorize commenters as individuals, non-profits, or corporations?
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">
                        <strong>Detecting Coordinated Efforts:</strong> How can we detect copy-paste campaigns or other coordinated submission efforts?
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 0.8rem;">
                        <strong>Tracking Influence:</strong> How can we systematically track which public comments influenced final regulatory outcomes?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic;">
                    Your unique perspective‚Äîwhether from government, nonprofits, academia, or elsewhere‚Äîis crucial for shaping the tools we build together.
