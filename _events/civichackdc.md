        <h2 class="section-title">üìä Why this matters üìä</h2>
        <div class="about-text" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 2rem auto 0; text-align: left;">
            <p>Each time a federal agency proposes new rules or seeks public input via <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regulations.gov</a>, thousands of comments pour in from individuals, advocacy groups, corporations, and more. Yet the data is notoriously difficult to access, analyze, and utilize effectively.</p>
            <p>To bridge this gap, Professor Ben Coleman and his students at Moravian University developed a robust open-source data pipeline. Powered by donated API keys, their tool continuously downloads and publishes public comments across agencies to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-ypmw3cvvwhv3y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S3 on AWS through its Open Data Platform</a>, making the comments freely available for exploration and analysis.</p>
            <p>On July 26, we're hosting a hackathon to create open-source tools that can be used to examine public comments on any future or past regulations or RFIs. We will explore several datasets, including a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/05/16/2025-08701/request-for-information-health-technology-ecosystem">recent CMS RFI</a> seeking input on improving the health tech ecosystem for patients. Professor Coleman will be on-site to walk participants through the data download tool and structure.</p>

        <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
            <p>We're actively seeking problem statements from policy experts to explore during the hackathon. If you have an idea, please submit it through our form; we'll review submissions and select key problems for participants to tackle. For example, one of our primary problem statements will address the recent CMS RFI on patient-centered health technology, but we encourage submissions on other topics as well.</p>

      In this collaborative, non-competitive event, participants will develop open-source tools designed for reuse with any public comment dataset, past or future, exploring questions such as:

      <div class="question-card">Who's commenting? (Individuals, nonprofits, corporations)</div>
      <div class="question-card">What are the major themes, sentiments, and sector-specific concerns?</div>
      <div class="question-card">Can we detect copy-paste campaigns or coordinated submissions?</div>
      <div class="question-card">What are organizations' historical commenting trends and motivations?</div>
      <div class="question-card">Which public comments directly influenced the final regulatory outcomes?</div>
